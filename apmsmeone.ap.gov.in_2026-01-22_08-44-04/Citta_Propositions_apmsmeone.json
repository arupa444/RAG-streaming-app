    "Issue 1: Land should be in the name of the SPV by the time of application under the scheme (clause-7C).",
    "Proposed Solution 1: The scheme approval may be in two phases: a. In-Principle approval (lands identified, SPV gives undertaking to make lands available within 3 months), b. Final Approval (after lands are registered in SPV's name and other formalities completed). This mechanism is followed in other Gol departments' interventions for MSMEs.",

    "Proposed Solution 2: A check mechanism that the member of the SPV has to transfer the lands by a registered deed in the name of the SPV, which cannot be reverted till the end of the project period or 25 years, may be placed.

    "Issue 3: Appraisal by commercial banks not up to the quality expected by SIDBI and long time for appraisal by SIDBI.",

    "Proposed Solution 6: Gol Grant is utilized fully for the purchase of Plant and Machinery (P&M). P&M are tendered by the State Implementing Agency, hence payment for P&M may be given @90% in the first installment (directly to the vendor by the SPV) and 10% after commissioning of P&M. The inspection can be done after commissioning or during installation to expedite grounding of the scheme.",

    "A hallmark is an official mark or series of marks struck on items made of precious metals.",
    "Hallmarks are a guarantee of certain purity or fineness of the metal.",
    "Hallmarks are determined by formal metal (assay) testing.",
    "Hallmark comprises five elements: BIS Mark, Fineness number, Assaying and Hallmarking Centre’s mark, Jeweller’s mark, and Year of marking.",
    "Laser marking is a new method of marking using lasers.",
    "Laser marking is valuable for delicate items.",
    "Laser marking is valuable for hollowware.",
    "Laser marking avoids damage or distortion caused by the punching process.",
    "Laser marking means finished articles do not need to be re-finished.",
    "Laser marking works by using high power lasers to evaporate material from the metal surface.",
    "Two methods of laser marking exist: 2D and 3D laser marking.",
    "2D laser marking burns the outline of the hallmarks into the object.",
    "3D laser marking simulates the marks made by punching.",
    "As BIS has made hallmarking mandatory, majority of cluster firms find it tough to know the purity of ornaments.",

    "The previous order referenced is GO MS No. 89, Finance (HR.I) Department, dated 16.07.2015.",
    "Annexure-I provides Guidelines for Procurement of Agencies and Individual Consultants for Consulting Services.",
    "The scope of these guidelines covers the procurement of Agencies for consulting services with specific scope of work and deliverables, or full-time consultants with specific job roles and responsibilities.",
    "The scope also covers the procurement of individual consultants directly by Procuring Entities for specific job roles, responsibilities, activities, or tasks.",
    "These guidelines are applicable to all Government Departments, Heads of Departments, and all State Autonomous Organizations (Companies, Corporations, Societies, Boards, Authorities, Institutions, Projects, etc.), referred to as Procuring Entities, regardless of funding source.",
    "Procuring Entities shall engage consulting agencies through one of the specified procurement options.",
    "The first option is to procure NISCI-Empanelled Agencies at rates not exceeding their empanelment rates.",
    "This NISCI-empanelment option must be mandatorily explored first.",
    "If requirements cannot be met by NISCI-empanelled agencies (with proper justification), Procuring Entities may opt for procurement through a Tender Process, using one of the specified Agency Selection Methods.",
    "For engaging Individual Consultants, Procuring Entities shall use the Individual Consultant Selection (ICS) method.",
    "In the case of the Tender Process option, one of the following Agency Selection Methods shall be employed:",
    "Quality-cum-Cost Based Selection (QCBS) involves evaluating proposals based on a combination of quality and cost criteria.",
    "QCBS is appropriate when the scope of work can be precisely defined, ToRs are clear, the scope is domain-specific requiring customization, and emphasis is on technical capability over financial quote.",
    "QCBS is also suitable when the scope requires high technical treatment and should be handled by a technically competent agency.",
    "In QCBS, the weightage ratio between Technical and Financial Evaluation is decided and specified in the RfP, with the Technical Score weightage being higher.",
    "The tender process includes a Technical Evaluation against pre-specified parameters.",
    "Agencies scoring above a cut-off Technical Score participate in the Financial Tender.",
    "In Financial Evaluation, the lowest quoted price receives the highest Financial Score, with others on a pro-rata basis.",
    "A Combined Technical & Financial Score (CTFS) is calculated for each agency.",
    "The agency with the highest CTFS is selected.",
    "Least Cost Selection (LCS) involves evaluating proposals separately on quality and cost criteria, ensuring minimum quality standards are met before considering the least cost.",
    "LCS is appropriate for small, standard, or routine assignments where the intellectual component is minor, well-established practices exist, and well-defined outcomes can be achieved at different costs.",
    "In LCS, a Technical Evaluation determines if agencies are qualified.",
    "Technically qualified agencies participate in the Financial Tender.",
    "Agencies are rank-ordered by price in descending order.",
    "The agency with the least price is selected.",
    "Single Source Selection (SSS) allows selecting a particular consulting firm under special circumstances with adequate justification in the overall interest of the Procuring Entity.",
    "SSS is appropriate when the assignment is a natural continuation of a previous competitively awarded contract with good consultant performance.",
    "SSS is also appropriate when the agency's availability is essential (e.g., emergency operations).",
    "SSS is used when only one consulting organization has the required qualifications, experience, or proprietary knowledge.",
    "In SSS, the ToR is shared with the prospective agency, which submits a Technical-cum-Financial Proposal.",
    "The Tender Evaluation Committee reviews and clears the proposal if appropriate.",
    "Negotiations are carried out on financial aspects, and the consulting fee is finalized as per guidelines.",
    "The agency is onboarded after necessary approvals.",
    "For individual consultants, the Procuring Entity shall use the Individual Consultant Selection (ICS) method.",
    "The Procuring Entity posts the requirement details in state/national dailies, consulting job sites, and their website.",
    "The posting includes the role title, scope of work, responsibilities, minimum education/experience, and competencies.",
